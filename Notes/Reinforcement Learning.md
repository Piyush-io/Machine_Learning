# Reinforcement Learning

This is similar but completely different to other systems.

- In Reinforcement Learning, the system is called an **_Agent_**.
- This Agent can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get feedback (**_awards_** or **_penalties_**) in return.
- It must learn by itself what is the best strategy, called **_policy_**, to get most reward over-time.
- A policy is the best possible action for the system when it is in a given situation.
