# Semisupervised Learning

In semisupervised learning the models are trained on a mixture of data, meaning some contain labels while some don't. Most semi supervised learning models are a combination of unsupervised learning and supervised learning algorithms.
One example is :

- Deep Belief Networks, which are based on unsupervised learning components called Boltzmann Machines. They are trained sequentially in unsupervised manner and the whole system is fine tuned using supervised learning techniques.
