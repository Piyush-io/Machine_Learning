# Supervised Learning

In Supervised Learning, we include the _results_ with the examples we use to train the model on called **_labels_**.

- A typical supervised learning task is Classification. One of its example is the spam filter in our gmail or any other mailing service we may use. The data(here, sample mails) we train it on also includes their labels(SPAM/NOT SPAM).
- Another typical supervised learning task is predicting numeric value , given a set of features called **_predictors_**. This type of task is called Regression.
  - Sometimes Regression models may also be used for Classification, for example, Logistic Regression is commonly used for Classifcation.
- Some important Supervised Learning Algorithms are:-
  - k-Nearest Neighbours
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Decision Tress and Random Forests
  - Neural Networks
