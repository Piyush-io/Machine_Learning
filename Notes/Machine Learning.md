# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the practice of programming the computers so they can learn from data.
Or we can say that we try to give the computer the ability to learn.
Machine Learning is great for:

- Complex problems which have inefficient solution or to say require a lot of hand tuning.
- Problems which don't have solutions using the traditional approach.
- Problems where we need to adapt to new data continuously.
- Getting insights about large amount of data and complex problems.

## Machine Learning systems can be classified in to broad categories based on :

1. Whether they are trained with human supervision on not (Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semisupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning)
2. Whether they can learn on the go, i.e. can they be trained again on new data after training once (Online Learning or Batch Learning)
3. Whether they work by simply remembering the data they were trained on or instead they try to learn patterns in the training data to make predictions. (Instance based Learning or Model Based Learning)

### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning

Machine Learning models can classified on the basis of amount and type of human supervision they are trained on.
There are four main categories:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semisupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
