This is similar but completely different to other systems.
- In Reinforcement Learning, the system is called an ***Agent***. 
- This Agent can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get feedback (***awards*** or ***penalties***) in return. 
- It must learn by itself what is the best strategy, called ***policy***, to get most reward over-time.
- A policy is the best possible action for the system when it is in a given situation.
